# Data access

How Toâ€™s for data access are building blocks to find, access, and download data. These notebooks are 
in development and rely on infrastructure that is under substantial development by 
outside developers to get more "stable" packages. Please let us know if you encounter 
any issues with these. Data access tutorials are currently all derived from the NASA OpenScapes cookbook.

## Data Access Notebooks covered here
* Creation and access to an S3 bucket
* Single and multi-file access to cloud optimized geotiffs via HTTPS and S3 buckets
