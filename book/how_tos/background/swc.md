# Software Carpentry Training

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) is a fantastic organization that teaches basic lab skills for research computing.

For past hackweeks we have offered unofficial, abbreviated 2-day software carpentry trainings to help everyone gain skills in fundamental data science tools (Git, Linux Terminal, Python). By offering this work in advance of the hackweek we can maximize the amount of time we get to focus on more advanced topics.

Below you will find links to our training materials from the 2021 SnowEx Hackweek. If you are new to Git, Linux, Python, please set aside a day or two to go over these materials in advance:

## Getting ready

Please take a minute before the workshop to go over the [GitHub instructions](./github.md),
create an account.

```{attention}
We will be using the JupyterHub ({{ jupyterhub_url }}) throughout this workshop.
We encourage you to test your [connection to JupyterHub](jupyterhub) before the training.
```
