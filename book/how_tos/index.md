# How To...

We welcome all types of learners to our cloud computing platform, from professional software 
developers to people just getting started. Here we provide guidance on how to join CryoCloud, background work that 
will be useful for working on a JupyterHub, and examples for accessing data from within the cloud. This is a list of our "How To" guides which can also be accessed via the contents list to the left:
