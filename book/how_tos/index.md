# How Tos

How Toâ€™s are building blocks to find, access, and download data. These notebooks are 
in development and rely on infrastructure that is under substantial development by 
outside developers to get more "stable" packages. Please let us know if you encounter 
any issues with these.

## Data Access Notebooks covered here
* Single and multi-file access to cloud optimized geotiffs via HTTPS and S3 buckets
* Single and multi-file access to NetCDFs and HDF5 files via S3 buckets

Still in development.
