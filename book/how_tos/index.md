# How Tos

We welcome all types of learners to our cloud computing platform, from professional software 
developers to people just getting started. Here we provide guidance on how to join CryoCloud, background work that 
will be useful for working on a JupyterHub, and examples for accessing data from within the cloud. 

These pages are a work in progress and we welcome ideas for improvements or pages that would be helpful to 
have included here.
