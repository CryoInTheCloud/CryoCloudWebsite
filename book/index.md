# Welcome to CryoCloud: Empowering collaborative Earth science in the cloud

CryoCloud is a NASA-supported community and cloud platform built in partnership with the International Interactive Computing Collaboration ([2i2c](https://2i2c.org/)) and designed to advance collaborative, data-intensive Earth science across all disciplines. CryoCloud embraces a broad vision‚Äîbreaking down silos, fostering intellectual generosity, and empowering scientists to make the most of NASA's vast data resources through streamlined data workflows.


## üöÄ Our Mission  
We aim to create an inclusive, interconnected research ecosystem that:
- **Reduces barriers:** Simplifies cloud adoption with cost-efficient and user-friendly tools and data workflows
- **Fosters collaboration:** Brings together data producers, engineers, computational experts, and domain scientists in a shared virtual space  
- **Drives innovation:** Accelerates impactful science with cutting-edge workflows and a commitment to open science  
- **Promotes sustainability:** Ensures long-term access to state-of-the-art computing and data resources

## üìö What You'll Find Here  
This JupyterBook is your gateway to the resources, tutorials, and tools developed by and for our community. Whether you're new to cloud computing or an experienced researcher, you'll find:
- Interactive [tutorials](tutorials/index) to get started with cloud-based data workflows
- Open-source tools and datasets tailored to NASA‚Äôs Earth Science disciplines
- A community ethos of sharing and collaboration, extending from Cryosphere research to the entire geoscience community

## üåê Join the Community  
Since 2022, we have grown from a Cryosphere-focused project into a community ecosystem that supports hundreds of domestic and international scientists across geoscience disciplines. Our goal is to empower Earth scientists by providing the community and technical mechanisms that accelerate time to science for their broad range of data workflows. Whether you're looking to build workflows, share insights, or connect with others, you belong here.
