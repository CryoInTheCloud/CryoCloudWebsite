```{note}
The CryoCloud is a JupyterHub built for NASA Cryosphere communities in partnership with the International Interactive Computing Collaboration [2i2c](www.2i2c.org). The CryoCloud cloud-computing environment spun up in Oct. 2022. The CryoCloud projects aim to establish a curated interactive computing platform and develop Cryosphere community expertise in using these platforms. The intention is to transition a NASA community into the cloud while discovering the needs and overall best practices for making this transition.
