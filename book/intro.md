```{Note}
This [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is in development as we launch the CryoCloud project.
```
The CryoCloud is a JupyterHub built for NASA Cryosphere communities in partnership with the International Interactive Computing Collaboration [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/). Launched in October 2022, the CryoCloud cloud-computing projects aim to establish a curated interactive computing platform and develop Cryosphere community expertise in open-soured and cloud-based platforms. The intention is to transition a NASA community into the cloud while discovering the needs and overall best practices for making this transition.

ðŸ“– On this JupyterBook website you'll find [tutorials](tutorials/index). All tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks, designed to be run interactively, but also rendered on this website for convenience.
