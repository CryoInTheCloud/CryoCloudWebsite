# CryoCloud Code of Conduct

## Reporting a Code of Conduct Violation

If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please immediately notify a [CryoCloud team member](https://github.com/orgs/CryoInTheCloud/teams/cryocloudadvanced). 

Notification should be done by contacting a CryoCloud team member on site or by emailing Tasha Snow at [tsnow@mines.edu](tsnow@mines.edu), Joanna Millstein at [jdmill@mit.edu](jdmill@mit.edu), Wilson Sauthoff at [sauthoff@mines.edu](sauthoff@mines.edu), or Matthew Siegfried at [siegfried@mines.edu](siegfried@mines.edu).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Anyone experiencing or witnessing behavior that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to public safety is advised to contact 911.

## Purpose

A primary goal of CryoCloud is to be inclusive to the largest number of community members, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.  A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open science citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

We invite all those who participate in CryoCloud to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## Community Standards

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to conduct open science using cloud computing resources. That requires an open exchange of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness, colleagues who are on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful comments and behavior may reasonably withdraw. If we have overly intrusive guidelines, people may feel unwelcome.

It would be impossible to list everything staff can do to create a more welcoming space, and we know this team will find ways to include their colleagues that we haven't even thought of. But when in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:

 * Practice empathy and humility.
 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work.
 * Listen carefully and actively.
 * Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners' context.
 * Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Treat other people's identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort to say people's names correctly and refer to them by their stated pronouns.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 * Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
 * Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
 * Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
 * Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

To help colleagues understand the kinds of behaviors that are illegal or run counter to the culture we seek to foster, we've listed below actions that are unacceptable within our community:

 * Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
 * Unwelcome verbal or written comment or physical conduct based on race, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, or political affiliation.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information without their explicit permission ("doxing").
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Inappropriate physical contact.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in person).
 * Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
 * Public or private harassment
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Enforcement 

### Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is participating in the project or its community. 

### Key Definitions 
* A **participant** is someone who has posted a comment or question on the [CryoCloud GitHub](https://github.com/CryoInTheCloud), [CryoCloud Slack](https://cryospherecloud.slack.com), or chat features provided by CryoCloud to the community during training events. Anyone who interacts with CryoCloud is a participant. 
* A **contributor** is an individual who has made a pull request or code commit to [CryoCloud GitHub](https://github.com/CryoInTheCloud). 
* A **moderator** is either (1) someone who is appointed to monitor the chat and respond to questions, comments and incidents during a training event, or (2) someone who has been given moderation access on GitHub. 
    * [GitHub defines a moderator](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-moderators) as “Moderators are organization members who, in addition to their permissions as members, are allowed to block and unblock non-member contributors, set interaction limits, and hide comments in public repositories owned by the organization.” GitHub moderators can hide comments, pull requests, and issues; block or unblock contributors; and limit interactions for certain users.
    * GitHub resources for moderation can be [found here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-moderators-in-your-organization#about-organization-moderators).
