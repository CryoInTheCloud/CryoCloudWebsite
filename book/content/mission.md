# Mission

## CryoCloud: Empowering Geoscience in the Cloud

CryoCloud is a **community-centric cloud-based computing ecosystem** designed to support geoscientists across disciplines. Our mission is to foster **collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity** by providing tools, training, and workflows that simplify cloud computing, enhance scientific impact, and reduce costs.

Our platform enables researchers to transition to cloud-based collaboration and data processing seamlessly, while ensuring that the needs of the geoscience community are met. CryoCloud builds on a foundation of intellectual generosity, interoperability, and community buy-in to create an inclusive environment where data producers, engineers, scientists, and developers collaborate to tackle pressing geoscience challenges, including managing and analyzing the growing volume of Earth observation data in the face of a changing climate.

## Core Principles

CryoCloud is guided by key principles that ensure our platform meets the diverse needs of our growing community:

- **FAIR and CARE Practices**: Develop workflows and data that are **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR)** while promoting **Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, and Ethics (CARE)**.
- **Cloud-Native Workflows**: Design geoscience workflows that maximize **accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, and interoperability**.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Foster collaboration across diverse scientific and technical domains to tackle complex geoscience challenges.
- **Equitable Support**: Provide training and support for users at all experience levels, ensuring inclusivity for underrepresented and under-resourced communities.
