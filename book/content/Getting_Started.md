# Getting started

Before gaining access to the JupyterHub, you need to join the [CryoCloudUser Github team](https://github.com/orgs/CryoInTheCloud/teams). This can be achieved by sending a message to cryocloud (at) mines (dot) edu. Someone will approve your request, send you an onboarding survey to get needed information to get you access, and invite you to join the Github team. Then you're ready to explore!
