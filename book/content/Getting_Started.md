# Getting started

Before gaining access to the JupyterHub, you need to join the [CryoCloud Github team](https://github.com/orgs/CryoInTheCloud/teams). This can be achieved by sending a message to cryocloud (at) mines (dot) edu. Someone will approve your request and bring you into the team, then you're ready to explore!
