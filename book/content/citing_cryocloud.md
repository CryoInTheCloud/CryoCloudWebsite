# Citing CryoCloud

To track the impact that CryoCloud has on publications and research output, 
we ask that any projects and publications that the CryoCloud supports, do one of two things: 

1. In the acknowledgements section, include CryoCloud and our NASA funding sources that make it possible for us to use CryoCloud (NASA grants 80NSSC22K1877, 80NSSC23K0002)

2. Cite us in your methods as you mention running your code using a JupyterHub:

Snow, Tasha, Millstein, Joanna, Scheick, Jessica, Sauthoff, Wilson, Leong, Wei Ji, Colliander, James, PÃ©rez, Fernando, James Munroe, Felikson, Denis, Sutterley, Tyler, & Siegfried, Matthew. (2023). CryoCloud JupyterBook (2023.01.26). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7576601.
