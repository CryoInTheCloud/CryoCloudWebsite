## How we work

The CryoCloud Community is collaborating to create this JupyterBook, with 
an eye towards how others could collaborate with us in the future.

The [CryoCloud Code of Conduct](../content/Code_of_Conduct) describes how we 
work to create an inclusive, diverse, and positive environment through 
continual learning, practice, and iteration.

We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. These are critical to 
uncovering enduring science-based solutions faster, as well as for the 
well-being and resilience of research communities. We work towards kinder science.

Our style of working is greatly influenced by:

-   [NASA Transform to Open Science](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science)
-   [NASA OpenScapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/)
-   [eScience Hackweeks](https://guidebook.hackweek.io/intro.html)
-   [The Turing Way Community Handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook.html)
-   [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development)

The CryoCloud JupyterBook is made with our [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) JupyterHub.
