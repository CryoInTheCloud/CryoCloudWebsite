[Hackweeks](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/36/8872.short) are participant driven events that have been designed, evaluated and modified over the past 10 years to meet the needs of emerging data science communities. Hackweeks were originally conceived within the [Moore/Sloan Data Science Environment](http://msdse.org/), and borrow ideas from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). 

Everyone involved in hackweeks, from participants to organizers, commit to our **[Code of Conduct](CoC)**.
