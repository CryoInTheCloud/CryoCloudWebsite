# NASA Earthdata Cloud and data access using earthaccess and icepyx

The following series of tutorials provides background on how to search and access NASA Earthdata. In particular, we provide background on the NASA Earthdata Cloud evolution and general cloud computing considerations, followed by a focus on NASA's ICESat-2 Mission. This introduction is followed by tutorials on two valuable python packages: `earthaccess` and `icepyx`, offering complementary search, access, and subsetting capabilities.
