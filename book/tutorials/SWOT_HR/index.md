# NASA SWOT High Resolution data access and comparison to ICESat-2

The following series of tutorials provides background on how to search and access NASA SWOT data and compare it to ICESat-2. 
In particular, we provide background on using `earthaccess` to search and access SWOT data, followed by a deep dive 
into ice shelf/ocean geophysical corrections for SWOT and making NASA's ICESat-2 Mission ATL06 data equivalent. 

## The following notebooks are included as part of this series:
* [SWOT High Resolution data search and access](./SWOT_HR_access.ipynb)
* [SWOT High Resolution Elevation over Ice Shelves and Comparison to ICESat-2](./SWOT_HR_w_IS2.ipynb)
