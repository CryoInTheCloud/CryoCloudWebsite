# Tutorials

These tutorials consist of Jupyter Notebooks that can be run in our
[JupyterHub](https://hub.cryointhecloud.com). If you are joining the CryoCloud, you have access to a JupyterHub environment
with all the necessary Python software packages installed that are needed to run
through these tutorials interactively. On JupyterHub, your home directory persists
so any changes you make to the tutorials will be saved and be there for you next
time you log in.

Note that the tutorials available in this JupyterBook are updated to reflect changes in the underlying software.
As a result, some code presented in these videos may differ from the updated Jupyter Notebook content.

All live tutorial recordings available via CryoCloud YouTube. Or see the table below for links to specific tutorial notebooks and recordings:
