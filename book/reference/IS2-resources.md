# ICESat-2 Resources

## Which tools should I use?

Navigating all of the tools available for working with ICESat-2 data can be challenging.
[NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/icesat-2/tools) and [icepyx](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/resources.html) have resource pages that provide information on many of the tools available for accessing and processing ICESat-2 data. [SlideRule](https://slideruleearth.io/) is not quite a tool, but rather a processing service for custom ICESat-2 data products that can be extremely helpful for a variety of tasks.

Finally, one of the best resources when working with a new remote sensing data product is the algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD), which describes exactly how each data product is generated. For ICESat-2 land ice, you can explore the [ATL03](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/icesat2_atl03_atbd_r005_0.pdf), [ATL06](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/icesat2_atl06_atbd_r005.pdf), [ATL11](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/icesat2_atl11_atbd_r005_0.pdf), [ATL14](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/icesat2_atl14_atl15_atbd_r001_0.pdf), and [ATL15](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/icesat2_atl14_atl15_atbd_r001_0.pdf) ATBDs. For ICESat-2 sea ice, you can explore the ATL07, ATL10, ATL20, and ATL12 ATBDs in a single document [here](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/icesat2_atl07_atl10_atl20_atl21_atbd_r005_1.pdf).
