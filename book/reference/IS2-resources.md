# ICESat-2 Resources

## Which tools should I use?

Navigating all of the tools available for working with ICESat-2 data can be challenging.
[NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/icesat-2/tools) and [icepyx](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/resources.html) have resource pages that provide information on many of the tools available for accessing and processing ICESat-2 data.
