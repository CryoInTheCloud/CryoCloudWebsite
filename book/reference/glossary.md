## Tools and Technology (general)

```{glossary}
[Binder](https://mybinder.org)
  A free, public service for running reproducible interactive computing
  environments. Binder is a 100% open source infrastructure that is run by
  members of the Jupyter community. The underlying technology behind the Binder
  project is BinderHub.

[BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io)
  The underlying technology of mybinder.org, BinderHub is an open source tool
  that utilizes a JupyterHub`= in order to provide live, reproducible
  interactive computing environments that users define on GitHub.

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io)
  Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R,
  Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN, and more.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely
  isolated environment called a container. It is widely used for creating
  reproducible software environments to run code on different computers.

[Git](https://git-scm.com)
  A popular version control system that is used in many open source software
  projects to manage their software code base.

[GitHub](https://github.com)
  Provider of Internet hosting for software development and distributed version
  control using the "git" command line tool.

[Hackweek](https://uwhackweek.github.io/hackweeks-as-a-service)
  Participant-driven events that strive to create welcoming spaces to learn new
  things, build community and gain hands-on experience with collaboration and
  team science.

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
  Project Jupyter (name derived from "JUlia PYThon and R") exists to develop
  open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing
  across dozens of programming languages.

[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
  Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful,
  publication-quality books and documents from computational material.

[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io)
  A core open source tool from the Jupyter community, JupyterHub allows you to
  deploy an application that provides remote data science environments to
  multiple users. It can be deployed in the cloud, or on your own hardware.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io)
  JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter
  intended to replace the JupyterNotebook interface.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyterbook.org)
  open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that
  contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

[MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io)
  Markedly Structured Text (MyST) is a rich and extensible flavor of Markdown
  meant for technical documentation and publishing. It is used by Jupyter Book.

[Slack](https://slack.com)
  A communication platform that we use to share information. We use separate channels
  for each project and also rely on the video features. If possible we recommend
  [downloading the Slack app](https://slack.com/downloads). If your agency does not allow
  you to use the app, you can still interface with Slack in a web browser.

```

## Topical (event specific)
```{glossary}
[ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov)
  Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (2).
  Launched in September 2018, the ICESat-2 satellite continues the ICESat and IceBridge missions to
  collect multi-year elevation data.
  Mission science goals focus on assessing changing land and sea ice and forest heights.
